The file config.yml contains the parameters that the plugin will use.
These will serve for all of your worlds if they are not overriden in the files
located into "Worlds_configs" directory.

In this folder, sub-directories exist: "NORMAL" and "NETHER."
Depending on your plugins, you can have others, such as "SKYLAND".
They allow to group configurations for your worlds by environment.

To override a setting for one of your worlds, simply copy it into the
file bearing his name. If you copy this parameter in the file
named "default_NORMAL_worlds" for example, this parameter will be used in all
worlds of type "NORMAL", unless of course you have overriden for a world
in particular.

So you can inherit all the settings that follow at your convenience.

But keep in mind 2 things:
- It seems that special characters (accents, cedilla, ...) do not pass.
- To override a parameter, including its structure. (see example)

Example:
To override the "player_death" parameter from section "points",
you have to write this:

points:
    player_death: -1

It's the YAML notation, used in configuration files (.yml)

Creepersday is my first bukkit plugin, I did it to understand how it works and
using a bit java language because I'm not familiar with it. So, if you encounter
problems, please be forbearing.

You will find below an explanation of the different settings.

---

* language

Indicates in what language will be posted the messages on the screen.
You can easily add more (and of course set different ones for each worlds).

Look at the "messages" section for more explanation on how to change
these messages, and add other languages.

The default values ​​are "EN" and "FR".

* status

Indicates the default status for creepers' day.
The possible values ​​are:
- active (begin with a creepers' day)
- random (IMHO, the best choice, starts creepers' days randomly)
- disable (creepers' days will never be triggered)

It will always be possible to force the startup or shutdown with the command
"creepersday start / stop" (if you have permission of course).

* creepersday_chance

This is the percent chance that one creepers' day is activated.
A test is performed once a day (morning).
Possible values ​​are 0 to 100.

* display_stats

Indicate if, at the end of the creepers' day, stats will be displayed.
Stats show the number of creepers killed and the number of deaths.
Possible values are "true" or "false".

* max_player_in_stats

Maximum number of players to show in the stats.
(ignored if "display_stats" is "false").

* points

Those settings are used to calculate the score at the end of a creepers' day
(ignored if "display_stats" is "false").

* points.kill_creeper

Points earned (lost if negative) when a player kills a creeper.

* points.player_death

Points earned (lost if negative) when a player dies.

* warn_player

Those settings indicate if the player should receive a message.
Possible values are "true" or "false".

* warn_player.on_start

When the creepers' day starts.

* warn_player.on_start_bonus

When he receive the bonus at the begin of a creepers' day.

* warn_player.during

When he join the server during a creepers' day.

* warn_player.on_respawn_bonus

When he receive the bonus for respawning during a creepers' day.

* warn_player.on_join_bonus

When he receive the bonus for joining the server during a creepers' day.

* warn_player.on_stop

When the creepers' day ends.

* warn_player.on_stop_bonus

When he receive the bonus at the end of a creepers' day.

* start_creepersday

This section contains the settings used when a creepers' day begins.

* start_creepersday.player_bonus

This subsection lists the items that will be given to players present on the
world where the creepers' day begin (only once: When it starts).

You can add or delete rows as you wish. YAML notation must also be employed here
like "NAME: NUMBER". To know which names you can use, take a look at this page:
http://jd.bukkit.org/doxygen/d7/dd9/namespaceorg_1_1bukkit.html#ab7fa290bb19b9a830362aa88028ec80a

You ask why I put eggs by default?
Then... Launch them during a creepers' day, you'll see :)

* start_creepersday.mobs_transformation

This subsection lists for each mob, the percent chance that it becomes a creeper
(to_creeper), and in this case, the percentage it becomes powered.

Tamed wolves will not be affected by the percentages of WOLF.

* during_creepersday

This section works like "start_creepersday". These are the settings used during
the creepers' day. The mob's percentages indicate the chance it will
automatically turn to creeper when it spawns.

Subtlety:

* during_creepersday.player_bonus

Here there are 2 parts: "on_join" and "on_respawn".
This is the list of items given to a player who joins the server during a
creepers' day ("on_join") and respawn ("on_respawn"). See explanation
of "start_creepersday.player_bonus" to learn how manage these lists.


* stop_creepersday

This section contains the settings when the creepers' day ends.

* stop_creepersday.creepers_transformation

This set of settings is used to convert creepers present in the world into
other mobs. "normal" indicates the management of conventional creepers and
"powered" is for powered creepers.

This percentage, but beware: The set for "normal", and for "powered" should be
a total of 100 maximum. The difference between 100 and your sum will represent
the percentage chance a creeper dies without being transformed into another mob.
This is why I put a comment line "nothing" into the default settings.
You can remove it if you wish.


* greetings

This part is optional: If you want to reward your players, according to their
rank, use this like that:

* greetings.rank<Number of the rank>.command

Contains the command to be executed to reward the player which got the rank
"<Number of the rank>". Beware: Do not put the "/" which begins command.

* greetings.rank<Number of the rank>.message

Contains the message to display to the player which got the rank <Number of the rank>

Some examples:
--------------

greetings:
    rank1:
      command: "give <player> DIAMOND 1"
      message: "Congratulations <player>, you win a diamond!"
    rank2:
      command: "money give <player> 100"
      message: "Congratulations <player>, you win 100 dollars!"
    rank5:
      command: "kick <player>"
      message: "<player>, You're a looser... Get out!"

* messages

This part works with the settings "language". If you use only one language,
you can delete others rows. You can change the messages as you like,
but remember that special characters are not accepted
(That's why I didn't put accents in French sentences).

To use a new language, you simply have to add lines under the other,
respecting the notation ' CODE: "SENTENCE" '.
"Code" is what you want, I've used "EN" for "English" and "FR" for "French" by
convention, but you are free to use you own.

For example, you can do like this:

messages:
    day_start:
        EN: "Creepers' day!!! BEWARE: Run, hide... Or die!"
        FR: "Jour des creepers !!! ATTENTION: Cours, caches toi... Ou meurs !"
        LOL: "Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!"

Then you can use "LOL" into "language" setting.

* messages.day_start

Message displayed to players when the creepers' day starts.
(if the "warn_player.on_start" parameter is "true").

* messages.day_active

Message displayed to incoming players during the creepers' day.
(if the "warn_player.during" parameter is "true").

* messages.day_stop

Message displayed to players when the creepers' day ends.
(if the "warn_player.on_stop" parameter is "true").

* messages.stats_title

First line of stats displayed at the end of creepers' day
("<max_player_in_stats>" Will be replaced by the value of "max_player_in_stats").
Only used when "display_stats" is "true".

* messages.stats_explanations

Second line of stats displayed at the end of creepers' day.
Only used when "display_stats" is "true".

* messages.bonus_start

Message displayed to players when they receive items at the creepers' day start
(ignored if "start_creepersday.player_bonus" is empty).

* messages.bonus_respawn

Message displayed to players who respawn during a creepers' day,
when they receive items.
(ignored if "during_creepersday.player_bonus.on_respawn" is empty).

* messages.bonus_join

Message displayed to incoming players during a creepers' day,
when they receive items.
(ignored if "during_creepersday.player_bonus.on_join" is empty).

* messages.bonus_stop

Message displayed to players when they receive items at the creepers' day end
(ignored if "stop_creepersday.player_bonus" is empty).

* advanced

You should not have to modify those settings, just in case...

* advanced.time_delay

Time interval between two checks by the plugin about the creepers' day state.
Necessary because of time commands, etc.. If your server is slow, increase this
delay but if you put a too big number, it can break some things.

* advanced.start_before

Maximum day hour for a creepers' day can start randomly. Only one real test is
done daily, but there is leeway for same reasons. You can reduce this setting,
but if you put a too small number, the creepers' day may never occur.

For memory, in Minecraft a day starts at 0 and ends at 24000.

* advanced.stop_after

Time of day at which the creepers' day can stop.
